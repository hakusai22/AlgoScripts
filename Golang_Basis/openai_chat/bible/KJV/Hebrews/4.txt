<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.
