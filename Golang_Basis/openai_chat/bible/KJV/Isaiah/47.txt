<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit on the ground: there is no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Take the millstones, and grind meal: uncover thy locks, make bare the leg, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and I will not meet thee as a man.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> As for our redeemer, the LORD of hosts is his name, the Holy One of Israel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called, The lady of kingdoms.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> I was wroth with my people, I have polluted mine inheritance, and given them into thine hand: thou didst shew them no mercy; upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: so that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart, neither didst remember the latter end of it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Therefore hear now this, thou that art given to pleasures, that dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thine heart, I am, and none else beside me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> But these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come upon thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries, and for the great abundance of thine enchantments.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee; and thou hast said in thine heart, I am, and none else beside me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from whence it riseth: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put it off: and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly, which thou shalt not know.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: there shall not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured, even thy merchants, from thy youth: they shall wander every one to his quarter; none shall save thee.
