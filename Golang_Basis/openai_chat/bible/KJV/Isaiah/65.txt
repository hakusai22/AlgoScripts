<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, even recompense into their bosom,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the LORD, which have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Thus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants' sakes, that I may not destroy them all.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> But ye are they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the drink offering unto that number.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose that wherein I delighted not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the Lord GOD shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they are the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the LORD.
