<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen. [It was written to Titus, ordained the first bishop of the church of the Cretians, from Nicopolis of Macedonia.]
