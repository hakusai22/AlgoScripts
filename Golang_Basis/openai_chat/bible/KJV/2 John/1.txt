<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.
