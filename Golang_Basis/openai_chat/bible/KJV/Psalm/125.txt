<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> They that trust in the LORD shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round about his people from henceforth even for ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Do good, O LORD, unto those that be good, and to them that are upright in their hearts.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace shall be upon Israel.
