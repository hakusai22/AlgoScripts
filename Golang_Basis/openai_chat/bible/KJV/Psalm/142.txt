<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the LORD did I make my supplication.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.
