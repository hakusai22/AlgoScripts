<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Then called I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> I said in my haste, All men are liars.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> What shall I render unto the LORD for all his benefits toward me?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> O LORD, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> In the courts of the LORD'S house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.
