<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only makest me dwell in safety.
